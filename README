This is a sample skeleton of initramfs required for DroidBoot.

Kexec and DroidBoot recovery binaries must be placed in sbin/ subdirectory.

The list of files to be included in resulting initramfs image is located
in initramfs_list.

An environment variable INITRAMFS_SOURCE_PATH needs to contain path
to the directory containing all the source files before starting kernel
compilation.
